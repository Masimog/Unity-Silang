# Unity-Silang
Code and development build for the game Silang, created using Unity game engine.



Silang is a serious game for developing language and communication skills in English among professionals, taking into account cultural aspects. The player after choosing his/her country of origin, his/her destination and the field of work he/she is intrested in goes through a simulation of what is like to apply for a job as well as participate in meetings with team members from different countries. A key aspect of Silang is that depending on the destination county, the accent of the non player characters change allowing the user to practise his/her communication skills in a multinational enviroment.

Silang was originally developed using Adobe flash. During my work for the Centre for Research and Technology â€“ Hellas (CERTH) i was given the files of the original game and was tasked to port it to Unity. After reviewing the code and playing the game to get a good understanding of its structure i managed to recreate it using C# in Unity as well as avoiding several bugs that existed in the original.
